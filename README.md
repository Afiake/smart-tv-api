# Smart TV API

This is a simple Java library for controlling a Samsung Smart TV that listens on port 55000 in an unencrypted manner.
Samsung TV's built in 2014 and later use encryption and can therefore not be controlled.

The protocol information has been gathered from here: http://sc0ty.pl/2012/02/samsung-tv-network-remote-control-protocol/
