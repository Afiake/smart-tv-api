Samsung TV Control
==================

This is a simple Java library/API which can be used to control a Samsung Smart TV that listens on port 55000.
I don't know for which product series that holds.

The protocol information has been gathered from: http://sc0ty.pl/2012/02/samsung-tv-network-remote-control-protocol/
